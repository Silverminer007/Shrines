### TODO

- [ ] Fix warning 'Potentially Dangerous alternative prefix `shrines` for name `trader_house`, expected `minecraft`. This could be a intended override, but in most cases indicates
  a broken mod.'
- [ ] Fix Terraforged compactability warning 'Was unable to check if minecraft:overworld is using Terraforged's ChunkGenerator.'
