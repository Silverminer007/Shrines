# This version of Shrines is neither supported, working nor complete

This is an experimental, incomplete, not yet working port of shrines using Architectury to fabric.
This won't get any updates, nor will it be finished.

The purpose of this version, is to provide a start-point for other modders to finish the port.
Therefore, this branch is still open for PRs/Contributions, but I (Silverminer007) can't and won't support it
in any way.
