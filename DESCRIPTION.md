![Introduction](https://bisecthosting.com/images/CF/ShrinesStructures/bh\_2.png)

Shrines is a uniquely customizable, rapidly expanding structure generation mod that is in steady development, and is regularly updated with a wide array of new or improved buildings. Minecraft's structures have their own style that should be respected, so Shrines never replaces pre-existing structures. Instead, this mod adds a new variety of diverse builds custom created to enhance Minecraft gameplay. A shrine is a monument, a structure with a distinctive purpose. Each one has a story to tell. Be a part of the story!

### Shrines is more than just structures:

**Custom structures**

Are you a structure builder? Have you always wanted to make your own builds spawn in Minecraft worlds naturally, but you didn’t know how to do that? Shrines allows you to add your structures to world gen, and it doesn't require any programming knowledge. For details visit our wiki: https://silverminer007.github.io/ShrinesWiki/wiki/en\_us/custom\_structures.html

**"Random" variation**

Have you ever felt like structures just don’t have enough diversity? Why shouldn’t there be    spruce or even a birch mansion? Shrines introduces an algorithm to create new variants of    structures as they generate into the world! Now there can be multiple unique variants of your favorite structures such as the Player House or the High Temple!&#x20;

Discover luxurious accommodations, loot, and hidden secrets inside of the Modern & Luxury Villas or brave the nightmares that lurk in the shadows of the Abandoned Villa dungeon. Venture into a haven of mystical wonder with the World Tree Manor or seek buried treasures across the landscape with newly added shrines, or if you’re just starting out in a new world, you can now find smaller cozier buildings to call home. Spend your afternoon relaxing in the new pavilion and your night sheltered safely in the rustic little hut down the river. Shrines has a little something for everyone, with even more on the way!

There so many people who deserve a thank you. First of all I want to say thank you to all people that contributed to Shrines in any way, but weren't listed here, just because the space is limited. Furthermore, a big thank you to everyone who downloaded Shrines, especially in the first three month. Without you downloading shrines, this mod wouldn't be as popular as it is right now.
