![Introduction](https://bisecthosting.com/images/CF/ShrinesStructures/bh\_2.png)

Shrines is a uniquely customizable, rapidly expanding structure generation mod that is updated from time to time. Minecraft's structures have their own style that should be respected, so Shrines never replaces pre-existing structures. Instead, this mod adds a new variety of diverse builds custom created to enhance Minecraft gameplay. A shrine is a monument, a structure with a distinctive purpose. Each one has a story to tell. Be a part of the story!

There so many people who deserve a thank you. First of all I want to say thank you to all people that contributed to Shrines in any way, but weren't listed here, just because the space is limited. Furthermore, a big thank you to everyone who downloaded Shrines, especially in the first three month. Without you downloading shrines, this mod wouldn't be as popular as it is right now.

Thank you to every one that reported bugs, proposed ideas and contributed to Shrines code. Your feedback is valued!
